<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Jaylan Howell and this is my profile page. 
I recently got into coding with HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript and so far I love it. I joined this group called TeenTech which teaches coding and it 
allowed me gain the knowledge about coding. Upon learning the fudamentals of HTML5.</p>
<p>So far I have come through very far in coding HTML5 as I
will also start doing Python, and PHP code to futher my education even more!</p>
<p>I decided to test and I recieved my certification for Microsoft! 
So I'm going to show some websites that I have made and practiced on before I got my certification. 
Legend says that Jaylan continues to make websites to this day. =)</p>
