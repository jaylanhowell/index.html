 <h1>Jordan's Shoes</h1>
 <h2>The Context of the Jordan Shoe</h2>
 <p> The jordan's are some of the most popular shoes which have 35 different versions of them. My favorite 
 shoe that jordan has made where the Jordan 12. The Jordan 12 shoe is the shoe that Jordan has worn
 mostly in his playoffs, and in some of his most iconic moments.
 <h2>The Flu Game</h2>
 <p> In one of Jordan's most important games were in Utah for game 6 where supposedly he had
 come up with the flu. Having the "flu" had many people questioned his
 ability to play, but wearing the iconic "Flu Game 12's", Jordan pulled through for his team and lead them to  a win.
